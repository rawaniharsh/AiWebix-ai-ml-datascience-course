    "## 🧠 What is a Closure?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Closure** is a function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remembers the variables** from the outer function\n",
    "- Even **after the outer function has finished**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "> A function carrying its **environment** (variables) along with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Real-World Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your mom packed a **tiffin** for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- She’s not there in school, but her **tiffin (function)** still has the **food (data)** she gave.\n",
    "- Wherever you go, you still have access to what she packed.\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Outer function = Kitchen  \n",
    "🍱 Inner function = Tiffin  \n",
    "🧂 Variables = Food  \n",
    "🏫 Closure = Using that food (data) later in school (outside function)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 Why Do We Need Closures?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create **customised functions** (like a counter, or logger)\n",
    "- To maintain **state** without using global variables or classes\n",
    "- Common in **decorators, logging, callback systems**\n",

    "## 🧩 How Closures Work:\n",

    "\n",
