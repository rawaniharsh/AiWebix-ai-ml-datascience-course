    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔍 What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a **child class** to inherit methods and properties from a **parent class**. It promotes **code reusability**, **clean structure**, and **easy maintenance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are building software for an **e-commerce platform**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `User`: A base class with common properties like name and email.\n",
    "- `Customer(User)`: A child class that adds address, cart, etc.\n",
    "- `Admin(User)`: Another child class that can manage users/products.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to write the code for name/email again — just **inherit** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Why Use Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔁 **Code Reusability** – No need to rewrite shared logic.\n",
    "- 🧱 **Extend Existing Code** – Add more functionality without touching base class.\n",
    "- 🛠️ **Maintainability** – If the logic changes in the parent, child gets updated too.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🏗️ Types of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type           | Description                                       |\n",
    "|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Single         | One child inherits from one parent                |\n",
    "| Multiple       | One child inherits from multiple parents          |\n",
    "| Multilevel     | Chain: Child → Parent → Grandparent               |\n",
    "| Hierarchical   | Multiple children inherit from one parent         |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "- `super()` – Used to call the parent class's methods or constructor.\n",
    "- Method Overriding – When the child class defines a method with the **same name** as the parent, it overrides the parent’s version.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forgetting to use `super()` when needed.\n",
    "- Accidentally overriding methods you didn’t mean to.\n",
    "- Overusing inheritance — prefer composition when behavior is different.\n",
