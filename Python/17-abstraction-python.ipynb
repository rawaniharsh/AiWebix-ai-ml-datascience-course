    "## 📌 What is Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** means **hiding complex implementation details** and **showing only the necessary features** to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to focus on **what** an object does instead of **how** it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like when you use a mobile phone:\n",
    "- You press a button to call someone (what)\n",
    "- You don’t need to know how signals are sent internally (how)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why Use Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keeps code **clean and simple**\n",
    "- Hides unnecessary details\n",
    "- Promotes **security** by exposing only essentials\n",
    "- Reduces complexity and increases reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 How Is It Done in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not support full abstraction like Java or C++, but we can achieve it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** from the `abc` module\n",
